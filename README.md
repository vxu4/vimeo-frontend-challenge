# Vimeo Front-end Coding Challenge

Used React to create a one-page static webpage with an animated (swipe) carousel at the top and 3 different movie thumbnails below it. Media queries were utilized to make the page and its components and layout reponsive to different screen sizes. 

## Getting Started

First, make sure you have npm and node installed. You can check the version and/or existence of npm and node on your computer with the following commands. 
```
npm -v
```
```
node -v
```
If either one is not installed, you can download it here: https://nodejs.org/en/.

Then, download or clone this repository to your local machine. 

### Running the Application

To run the application, navigate into the folder repo, install the project's dependancies, and then start the application.

Installing packages:
```
npm i
```
Running the application: 
```
npm start
```

It should open a browser window with the app at http://localhost:3000, for viewing the application.
